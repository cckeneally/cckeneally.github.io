- title: "(Conference) Microbial ecology & methane production in a hypersaline coastal lagoon"
  image: SFS.png
  description: This conference presentation explored the Coorong, a hypersaline coastal lagoon in Australia, and its role in methane emissions, a key aspect of the global greenhouse gas cycle. The study highlighted how the system's unique conditions could increase methane release - in an environment often overlooked in climate models. By combining insights from microbial ecology, biogeochemistry, and limnology, the research aims to improve our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from coastal wetlands.

  image: basinplan.jpg
  description: The Coorong estuary in South Australia is a crucial 'sentinel' of the overall health of the larger Murray-Darling Basin. Environmental efforts have helped its ecosystem, particularly by managing salt levels and supporting fish habitats, but challenges like sand buildup still remain. This work highlights the ongoing need for better water management in the area.

- title: "N and C Isotope Variations Along an Extreme Eutrophication and Salinity Gradient in the Coorong Lagoon, South Australia"
  image: priestly2022.png
  description: Nitrogen and carbon isotopes (δ15N and δ13C) were utilized to investigate geochemical cycles in the Coorong. The research established a relationship between phytoplankton production and the composition of suspended organic matter. It was found that variations in salinity and eutrophication directly impacted the δ15N and δ13C values. The study revealed that algal material is the primary source of nitrogen in the lagoon's sediments, highlighting important aspects of nitrogen cycling in this valuable ecosystem. This research suggests that sediment δ15N values can be indicative of historical productivity levels in such environments.
