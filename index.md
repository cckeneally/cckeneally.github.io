Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm a researcher working in the Freshwater & Ecophysiology research group, led by [Prof. Justin Brookes](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/justin.brookes) at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) This website is my portfolio and blog wrapped together, showcasing my qualifications, research outputs, thoughts about science, and ongoing projects.

I have worked on a range of South Australian government research programs during my studies. My current PhD research aligns with [Project Coorong](https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/coorong), which is a joint Australian Federal and South Australian government program aiming to restore aimed at restoration of this unique wetland ecosystem.

My work ranges broadly from remote boat-based fieldwork, to wet lab microbiology & "dry-lab" bioinformatics. Much of my code for the latter (and some statistical analyses) will be featured here, alongside more tangential side-projects.
